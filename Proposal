Enhancing Healthcare Accessibility Through Machine Learning: An ANN-based Approach to Understanding Transportation Perceptions

Introduction
Transportation plays a critical role in daily life, influencing access to essential services like healthcare. In South Carolina, the effectiveness of transportation systems greatly impacts healthcare accessibility, particularly for vulnerable groups such as low-income households, minorities, the elderly, and disabled individuals. These groups often face challenges like high travel costs, physical barriers to transportation, and safety concerns, which can prevent access to necessary healthcare services.
Recent studies highlight how transportation perceptions vary significantly with demographic and geographic factors, influencing access to healthcare (Chen et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2021). This project builds on this foundation by employing machine learning to model these complex relationships, providing a deeper, data-driven understanding of the barriers to healthcare accessibility. By examining the associations between perceived transportation disadvantages and healthcare inaccessibility in South Carolina through a comprehensive survey and employing a structural equation model (SEM), this research seeks to uncover nuanced data capturing the perceptions and experiences of different demographic groups.

Data
The study will utilize data from the South Carolina Healthcare survey processed by our research group which assess perceptions of transportation and healthcare accessibility across various demographics and geographic locations within South Carolina. Additionally, multidimensional built environment from EPA Smart Location Database and socio-demographic data from the U.S. Census will be applied.

Methodology
Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), offers a powerful tool for modeling complex relationships in this context. An artificial neural network (ANN) will be developed to model the associations between perceived transportation disadvantages and factors like socio-demographic characteristics and the built environment. This approach will leverage existing frameworks TensorFlow for model development. Modifications may include adjusting network architecture or training procedures to enhance model performance and interpretability.

Evaluation and Expected Outcomes
The model's effectiveness will be evaluated through metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Expected outcomes include detailed maps and visualizations of transportation perceptions and their impact on healthcare accessibility, which could significantly inform targeted interventions.
